# Atliq Hospitality PowerBi Project

## Project Overview

This project provides an in-depth exploration of the hospitality domain through the lens of a Power BI dashboard. Leveraging insights from Codebasics' tutorial, guided by Abhishek Anand and Hemanand, I undertook a real-time process encompassing client discussions, dashboard mockup creation, data understanding, cleaning, modeling, and DAX-based metric implementation.

## Project Objectives

The main objective was to develop a Power BI dashboard for Atliq Grands in the Hospitality Domain, augmenting my resume with a real-world project. The challenge was to deliver valuable insights to the Revenue Team at Atliq Grands.

## Client Background

Atliq Grands, a stalwart in the hospitality industry with multiple five-star hotels across India, faced market share and revenue challenges. This was attributed to strategic competition and ineffective management decisions.

In response, the managing director initiated the incorporation of "Business and Data Intelligence" to regain market share and revenue. My contribution was the creation of a Power BI dashboard, aiding Atliq Grands in their recovery journey.
